# sql-challenge
1. SQL assignment was a bit easier to crack.
2. Created the tables in order of: titles, employees, departments, dept_emp, dept_manager, salaries.
3. Used the inbuilt tool in PGAdmin to generate ERD diagram - which was much easier than to use other external resources.
4. Creating tables, and generating ERD diagrams were done simultaneously- hence created schema.sql, and ERD.png.
5. Resolving each scenario in the assignment was pretty straightforward:  Hence created views in my pgadmin as i solved each of the question.
6. I also added orderby for every scenario to the result is ordered by ascending by default - except for the last question which was specific desc order.
